              Hi, I'm Katherine! I'm a junior at Brown University, where I precariously hobble between computer science and other means of making. I’m predominately interested in combining my experiences in teaching and the arts with tech. This semester, I will be working
              as a monitor in training at the BDW, doing graphic design and managing media for the Sarah Doyle Center for Women & Gender, and 
              finding every opportunity possible to create and grow. I also am involved with STEAM, Hack@Brown, and the College Independent, where
              I do a variety of activities, from outreach to managing Medium pages to designing layouts. <br /> <br />
              
              Everything I do is with the goal of making light and life out of static elements, whether it be a table that is given movement through its curves, a short story that has a crinkly smile, or an exciting piece of code that runs.
            </p>
