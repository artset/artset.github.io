              Hi, I'm Katherine! I'm a junior at Brown University, where I study
              computer science and its intersections with art, writing, and teaching.
              This semester, I will be working
              as a monitor in training at the Brown Design Workshop, 
              a publicity coordinator and graphic designer the Sarah Doyle Center for Women & Gender, and 
              finding every opportunity possible to create and grow. 
              I am involved with STEAM, Hack@Brown, and the College Independent, where
              I do a variety of activities, from teaching workshops to managing Medium pages to designing layouts. 
              <br /> <br />
              
              Everything I do is with the goal of bringing life to static elements, whether it be a table 
              given movement through its curves, a short story with a crinkly smile, or 
              an exciting piece of code that runs.
            </p>
