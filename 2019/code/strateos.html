          <h4>Context</h4>
        <p>
        I had the privilege of working at <a href="https://strateos.com/">Strateos</a>
        as a Design Engineer intern in summer 2019. 
        This was an amazing opportunity for me to be involved in a variety
        of projects, from web development and UI/UX to product design.
        At the end of my internship, I presented projects of interest to the company,
         <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bihQADNuPcviENBMFLTVwDwsi1foaUhw/view?usp=sharing">which you can view here.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
        Strateos is a biotech company that leverages robotics to automate run bio assays. When I arrived, the
        company had recently gone through a merger and was rapidly expanding into a much larger
        lab, along with new features to support automating chemistry.
        </p>

        <p> <b>Long story short:</b> In regarding to web development,
          I designed the compound/inventory linking feature for the chemistry expansion. 
          Additionally, I streamlined workflows for developers by rebuilding the
          Amino design system documentation site 
          in Gatsby to automate component documentation.
          I also created a variety of components in Amino
          for the chemistry section of the web app. Given the merger (new name! new logo! new colors! new type!),
          I was also responsible for creating 
          backwards compatible code to shift various elements of the design system to align with the 
          new branding guidelines. I did this work within the UI library in Sketch, 
          along with the codebase in React.

          Lastly, I had done 
          a ton of fun side projects, such as being involved in the rebranding process and creating assets
          such as business cards and social media banners.
        </p>

        <p> Now, I'll go in detail of two independent projects that I had worked on for the web app and the 
          design system, then just show extra fun assets! :)
        </p>


        <h4>UI/UX: Compound/Inventory Linking</h4>

        <p>
          Due to a partnership with Eli Lily and a new lab in the works, the Strateos product
          was expanding to support automating
          compound synthesis. There had already existed an inventory section to keep track
          of assays. Given the new feature of compound synthesis,
          we needed a way to keep track of which compounds were in which containers. 
          This is where compound/inventory linking comes in!
        </p>

        <p> I conducted in depth interviews with application scientists, chemists,
          and internal Strateos employees in the new labs that would interact with this feature.
          <br> <br>
          I identified two users that would require slightly different experiences:
          <Br> <b>Internal users</b>: Chemists and operations at the new lab would need to create this link.
            The link would tend to come in the form of a CSV and handle hundreds of vials. Thus,
            manual support would be too laborious.
          <br> <b>External users</b>: Chemists at companies such as Eli Lily and Amgen work at a much smaller scale 
          to create these links, thus manual linking would be sufficient.
        </p>

        <p> Next, I did research to find out where in the existing web app would users go to to create
          this link -- compound or inventory?
        </p>

        <i>"Chemists are always thinking about the compound, so they would go to the compound page."</i> (User findings)

        <br> <br>

        <div class="main"><img src="../assets/strateos/userflow.jpg" /></div>
        <div class="whisper">Based on the mentality of a chemist, I realized that the feature
          must start at the compound page. I identified three contexts in which users would interact with this feature, then mapped
            out a user diagram where my mocks would be based off of. </div>

            <div class="pic-set">
                <img src="../assets/strateos/lowfi1.jpg" />
                <img src="../assets/strateos/lowfi2.jpg" />
                <img src="../assets/strateos/lowfi3.jpg" />
              </div>

        <p>Here are quick snapshots of my high fidelity work.</p>

        <p>
            Note: The UI/UX section of this page will not have high res walk throughs of all the mocks,
            but they are featured at the end of the
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bihQADNuPcviENBMFLTVwDwsi1foaUhw/view?usp=sharing">slide deck</a>.</p>

        <div class="main"><img src="../assets/strateos/manual_flow.png" /></div>
        <div class="whisper">An overview of the manual flow high fidelity mock. </div>
  
        <p>
          In regards to bulk tagging, I interviewed internal members to understand their workflow with the CSV
          and created a CSV template and flow to create this experience. Given that CSV uploads can result in 
          numerous errors, I examined all the use cases and created error handling designs that would
          prompt the user to various actions to resolve the error.
        </p>

        <div class="main"><img src="../assets/strateos/inventory_creation_flow.png" /></div>
        <div class="whisper">An overview of the inventory creation flow.</div>

        Lastly, I had done redesigns of the compound and inventory pages to display the results of these links.
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JmTpVaXVizebhiUeCgasdMqC3pwVoEni/view?usp=sharing">Here is the video demo.</a>
        <br> <br>

        <p>Working on this project was an incredible experience because I was able to design a feature
          that is relevant to the next steps of the product. Additionally, given
          my lack of background in the life sciences, I found it crucial to make the most out of user research
          in order to shape the solution. Currently, these mocks are handed off to engineering for development.

        </p>

        <h4>Amino Documentation Website: Gatsby Migration</h4>

        <p>Amino is the design system that all of the Strateos products consume. This project largely
          focused on streamlining the workflow for developers, while giving the users of Amino
          an accessible and reliable way to use Amino. You can view my final project
        <a href="https://amino.transcriptic.com/">here.</a> </p>


        <p><b> Problem: </b> The documentation site, a separate codebase from Amino, is finnicky to update.
          Given how quickly Amino was expanding to supply molecular drawers/renders, along with other 
          components, documentation was an overwhelming task for the developer.</p>

        <div class="main"><img src="../assets/strateos/gatsby_direction.png" /></div>

        <p><b> Solution: </b> I used Gatsby, a static site generator, to build the app. Gatsby is useful since 
          it can query data to transform into templates. I used GraphQL to transform 
          component data into <a href="https://amino.transcriptic.com/components/button">a usage page, an interactive component demo, and a props table. </a>
          I added a markdown feature in the Amino to function
          as a place where additional comments on component usage could be queried. There is a filter
          such that only components with markdown pages can be viewed on the website, because
          this means that the design process for these components have been deeply thought through.
          
          I integrated this into the documentation for releasing new versions of Amino, such that the website
          will be rebuilt and deployed whenever large feature changes are made to Amino.
        </p>

        <div class="main"><img src="../assets/strateos/amino.png" /></div>
        <div class="whisper">Here's a screenshot of the landing page! But why look at this 
          when you can just <a href="https://amino.transcriptic.com/">check out the project?</a>
        </div>

        <h4>Fun design things </h4>

          <img src="../assets/strateos/business4.png" />
          <img src="../assets/strateos/business5.png" />
        </div>

        <div class="whisper">Various business card designs! The managers ultimately chose the bottom one.</div>

        <h4>Final thoughts</h4>

        <p> I had an amazing time working at Strateos this summer. In addition to building UI that was highly relevant to the product and work with numerous codebases,
          I had an amazing mentor who helped shape this wonderful experience. I learned a ton about
          maintaining and building complex, high quality products, as well as getting involved with
          rigorous user research. Thanks for reading! :)
