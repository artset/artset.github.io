                <a href="http://www.gooey.blue">gooey.blue</a> is a graphic design tool to help anyone explore, iterate, and develop a visual identity.  <br /> <br />

                <h4>Context</h4>

                <p>
                    Developing branding can be fairly daunting for anyone. Finding design inspiration is quite decentralized -- there are so many sites for looking at fonts, creating a perfect palette, and synthesizing it all into an identity. Thus, my friend Minna and I were inspired to create a website that solved this problem. We wanted to build a space where people can easily synthesize their explorations into a stylesheet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with 3 other members (Minna, YJ, and Anna) to develop gooey over the course of a month. I focused on building the frontend with Minna, and developing a palette recommendation algorithm with Anna. In regards to the front end, I collaborated with Minna on user research, developing mocks, and React implementation. For the algorithm, Anna and I developed heuristics and leveraged a soft clustering machine learning algorithm to generate appealing colors. I closely worked with potential users to develop the product, as well as to refine and validate the algorithm.

                <h4>Introducing Gooey</h4>

                <div class="main main--border">
                    <img src='../assets/code/gooey_dash.png' />
                </div>
                <p class="whisper"> First, a user is invited to make a workspace, essentially a space that represents a project</p>


                <div class="main main--border">
                    <img src='../assets/code/gooey_quiz.png' />
                </div>
                <p class="whisper">  Then, they can take a quiz, where they can choose colors that go with the vibe of their project</p>

                <div class="pic-set pic-set--border"> 
                    <img src='../assets/code/gooey1.png' />
                    <img src='../assets/code/gooey2.png' />
                    <img src='../assets/code/gooey3.png' />
                    <img src='../assets/code/gooey4.png' />
                 </div>

                 <p class="whisper">  After, they are taken to a gallery page, where they receive stylesheet recommendations. Users can like cards, which will inform the algorithm. They can also regenerate cards infinitely. Above are the galleries for 4 different workspaces -- note that the algorithm really captures various "themes" of colors, from earth tones, neon, and pastels. </p>

                 <div class="main main--border">
                    <img src='../assets/code/gooey_stylesheets.png' />
                </div>

                <p class="whisper">  Lastly, the user can transform their liked cards into stylesheets. Here, they can further iterate on their designs by adding more colors, adjusting the fonts, and sharing the stylesheets with their friends!</p>

                <p> If you're curious to learn more about the algorithm that Anna and I developed, we wrote a fairly extensive write up <a href="http://www.gooey.blue/about">here.</a> It's fairly experimental and was unlike any of the literature that we read on color palette generation and recommendation, so we are really excited to share it!</p>

                <h4> Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    This project was utterly a joy to work on and taught me a ton about real world product design and development. Although team members were scattered across 3 different time zones, 13 hours apart, we still managed to pull together a project that we are proud of :) It was incredibly satisfying to see our work culminate into a cohesive app. I am so proud of how our team thoughtfully considered every feature, from developing measurements for hue preference to adorable flip animations. I hope you'll check out the  <a href="http://www.gooey.blue/">final product.</a>
