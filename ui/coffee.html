          <h4>Introduction</h4>

          <p>
            As a design exercise for UI/UX, three other peers (Minna, <a href="http://juliewang.me">Julie</a>, Dain) created a rebranding and new website design for a start up, Buy Me Coffee. Buy Me a Coffee makes it easy for online creators to get paid. In the generation of crowdfunding with products such as Kickstarter and Patreon,  Buy Me a Coffee takes a new angle by emphasizing small donations. Without looking at the current branding for Buy Me Coffee, we created a stylesheet, logo, and high fidelity mock-ups solely based on the premise of the start up. We developed numerous iterations of our designs based on feedback from <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting.com</a>.
          </p>

          
          <h4> Process</h4>

          <p>
            For our low fidelity mock-ups, we experimented with multiple layouts that could potentially serve both creators and donors. The most difficult part of the low fidelity mock-ups was to concisely and clearly convey the essence of the service, without isolating a user group. We ultimately chose a low fidelity mock-up that equally welcomed the two user groups.
          </p>
        
          <div class="pic-set--main">
              <img src="../assets/ui/coffee/sketches/sketch1.jpg" />
              <img src="../assets/ui/coffee/sketches/sketch2.jpg" />
              <img src="../assets/ui/coffee/sketches/sketch3.jpg" />
          </div>

          <p class="whisper">
              Julie sketched out these low fidelity sketches. We ended up choosing the right most because the home page best represented the diverse target audiences of users (artists, podcasters, educators), while the profile page enabled the user to engage with its fans through posts and a gallery of their content, rather than focusing on monetary statistics.
          </p>

    

          <div class="side_pic side_pic--right side_pic--border">
            <img src='../assets/ui/coffee/stylesheet.PNG' /> 
           <p class="whisper"> </p>
       </div>

            <p>
                After establishing the structure of the website based on the low fidelity mock ups, my group had a ton of fun with the branding. We wanted to give a cozy, casual, cafe vibe that <br />welcomed our users, leading us to use a kooky slab serif, Zillo Slab, for the header. Here, we established a warm palette, as well as established core UI elements, such as a primary button and stylized dropdown, with our stylesheet.
            </p>

        <div class="pic-set--main">
            <img src="../assets/ui/coffee/iterative/pay.png" />
            <img src="../assets/ui/coffee/iterative/pay--card.png" />
        </div>

        <p class="whisper">
            One of my responsibilities as a group member was to develop the high fidelity mock-ups for the donation flow. I collaborated with Minna, who made these incredible graphics. These were the initial mid fidelity designs.
        </p>

        <div class="pic-set--main">
            <img src="../assets/ui/coffee/final/purchase_treat--not-select.png" />
            <img src="../assets/ui/coffee/final/purchase_treat--personalize.png" />
            <img src="../assets/ui/coffee/final/purchase_treat--pay.png" />
        </div>

        <p class="whisper">
            After our critical feedback session, some individuals noted that the donation pageâ€™s back navigation was clunky. Additionally, the flow felt like a discontinuation from the previous page, which was an artist's profile page. Thus this is the second batch of iterations, which utilized the profile page's header.
        </p>

        <h4> User Testing</h4>
        <p>After we finalized <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/wAsw5G540Iw4CNsqYwGOXX/Buy-Me-A-Coffee---Interaction?node-id=3%3A29&scaling=scale-down">these mockups</a>, we sent them off to <a href="http://usertesting.com">UserTesting.com</a> to get more feedback from others. Out of our users, we had a 100% success rate on tasks such as navigation to a specific user's page, selecting a coffee for donation, and viewing stats as an artist. However, we had a 66% success rate from the task to actually purchase a coffee; some users stated having an issue with scrolling down on the page, as well as unclear confirmation. In the future, we would like to update our designs to respond to these issues. </p> 

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            Overall, I had a ton of fun collaborating with my peers to create this redesign. One of the greatest parts of this experience was being able to work with everyone's strengths to create a finalized product -- from distilling the company's message into low fidelity mocks to refining the user experience. I hope to do more collaborative work in the future! :)
