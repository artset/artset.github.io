        During summer 2018, I helped Andrew Duca and George Lee transform their basic wireframes
        into high fidelity prototypes to help them build their app. In addition, I was
        involved in iterating upon their wireframes to improve the UX and design complementary
        graphics to easily explain how to use the app.

        The purpose of Gaggle is to crowd source purchasing of groceries and food. For research,
        I reviewed and noted the design decisions in similar apps such as Postmates, Uber eats,
        and Lyft. A crucial difference b/w those apps and Gaggle is that Gaggle aims to seamlessly combine
        the delivery and shopping into a single app.

        In the beginning, here were some preliminary styles I had designed.

        <br>

        Based on feedback to communicate the approachable, reliable, and connection-oriented nature
        of the app, I iterated to create the final design styles, using Futura PT for the
        heading and Proxima Nova for the body.

        Afterwards, I split the navigation functions, designing logical tracks for the deliver and
        shopper pages. Based on the refined wireframe plan, I constructed the rest of the pages
        and iterated upon them for clarity and convenience. I added a popular items page per store,
        and a quick filter search design. I used feedback from potential users of the app
        to refine the design.

        Here are the iterations for the graphics explanations and the final! <br>

        Through this project, I refined my knowledge of adobe XD, learned
        illustrator, and used iterative design to create the best UI
        for this app. In the future, I want to be able to have the opportunity
        for user testing in order to refine the functionality of my design.
