      <p> I've done a variety of graphic design work, whether it a 30+ page education
        catalog, restaurant menus, works for literary arts magazines and newspapers, or posters for organizations
        that promote causes that I care about. Here is my most recent work in the past 2 years.

        <p class="whisper"> Select works from my time at the Brown Center for Students of Color, including
          a poster for a screenprint & chill event by the Asian American Heritage Series, a dinner by the 
          Black Heritage Series, and the closing end of year part for the BCSC. In 9 months, I had 
          produced ~30 print pieces, closely working with ~20 event organizers.</p>

        <p class="whisper"> I also had the privilege of creating the TWTP (Third World Transition Program. one of
          Brown"s freshman pre-orientations programs) brochure. It"s pretty cool because I attended the program
          freshman year! <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/79822743/Posters-BCSC-2018-2019">See more work I made for the BCSC.</a>

            In summer 2019, I was commissioned to design a 30+ page catalog for Baker&Bloom, an education center in Hong Kong. The catalog featured the course schedule, general information about the center, and synopses of each of the classes. I worked remotely, actively communicating with the founder and teachers by creating this catalog over the course of 3 weeks.

            As of fall 2019, I've had the honor of working as the publicity coordinator and graphic designer at the Sarah Doyle Center for Women and Gender. I get to continue my tradition of the hunt for the perfect type, colors, and images to bring light and energy to the wonderful events faciliated at this center!
