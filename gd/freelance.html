      <p> I've done a variety of graphic design work, whether it a 30+ page education
        catalog, restaurant menu, works for literary arts magazines and newspapers, or posters for organizations
        that I strongly believe in. Here is my most recent work in the past 2 years.

        <p class="whisper"> Select works from my time at the Brown Center for Students of Color, including
          a poster for a screenprint & chill event by the Asian American Heritage Series, a dinner by the 
          Black Heritage Series, and the closing end of year part for the BCSC. </p>

        <p class="whisper"> I also had the privilege of creating the TWTP (Third World Transition Program. one of
          Brown's freshman pre-orientations programs) brochure. It's pretty cool because I actually attended it
          freshman year! <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/79822743/Posters-BCSC-2018-2019">See more work I made for the BCSC.</a>

            In summer 2019, I was commissioned to design a 30+ page catalog for Baker&Bloom, an education center in Hong Kong. The catalog featured the course schedule, general information about the center, and synopses of each of the classes. I worked remotely, actively communicating with the founder and teachers by creating this catalog over the course of 3 weeks. 
        </p>

        For the fall 2019, I will be continuing to do freelance work at the Sarah Doyle Center, as well as managing their
        newsletter and other odds and ends. Check back as I update this page when I do more work there! :)
