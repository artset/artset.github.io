      <p> From the bright-eyed age of 8, I became addicted to word art. Although my days early 2000s graphic design aesthetic is gone, I still love designing. Specifically, I aim to design for institutions and individuals that give spaces to causes I find importance -- such as the gender center at Brown, POC community, teaching centers, and publications.

    <p class="whisper"> In 2020, I developed the visual identity, logo, tote bags, and various event posters for the Women History Series for the Sarah Doyle Center. The root imagery was inspired by the fact that the radish comes from the same etymology as the word "radix", or "root". Thus, I sought to express how radical feminist is centered around exploring the origin of inequality and being mindful of ones own origins and relations with the land.</p>

    <p class="whisper"> Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, the Women History's Series events were cut short. However, the Sarah Doyle Center maintained an online space for the community. I helped with creating media for the blog. Here are a few of my favorite images that I created.</p>

        <p class="whisper"> From 2018-2019, here are select works from my time at the Brown Center for Students of Color, including
          a poster for a screenprint & chill event by the Asian American Heritage Series, a dinner by the 
          Black Heritage Series, and the closing end of year part for the BCSC. In 9 months, I had 
          produced ~30 print pieces, closely working with ~20 event organizers.</p>

        <p class="whisper"> I also had the privilege of creating the TWTP (Third World Transition Program. one of
          Brown's freshman pre-orientations programs) brochure. It"s pretty cool because I attended the program
          freshman year! <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/79822743/Posters-BCSC-2018-2019">See more work I made for the BCSC.</a>

            In summer 2019, I was commissioned to design a 30+ page catalog for Baker&Bloom, an education center in Hong Kong. The catalog featured the course schedule, general information about the center, and synopses of each of the classes. I worked remotely, actively communicating with the founder and teachers by creating this catalog over the course of 3 weeks.
