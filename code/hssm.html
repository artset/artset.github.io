                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>
                    Emojis are an interesting phenomenon of language, given they are universally used throughout many
                    languagse. Due to this aspect of emojis, I worked with 3 other peers, Minna, Maggie, and Iris, to
                    explore the usage of emojis across different languages. This was a free flowing exploration to see
                    the nuances of how different languages used emojis through sentiment analysis and context.
                </p>

                <h4>Initial Explorations in Sentiment</h4>

                <p>
                    Gathering our data from Twitter, we scraped over 250,000 tweets over the course of two months. We
                    queried the Twitter API for emojis of different categories, then placed the data in a SQL database.
                    We were curious about sentiment analysis, so we used BlobText to classify the sentiment of each
                    tweet as we queried Twitter. Then, we applied the kmeans algorithm to create clustering for each of
                    the words. 
                </p>

                <div class="pic-set--main">
                    <img src="../assets/code/sentiments.png" />
                </div>
                <p class="whisper">
                    Our initial visualization in MatPlotlib, which we used to cluster our three emojis into three
                    categories -- positive (red), neutral(yellow), and negative(blue), indicated by the color in the
                    bottom right. We had a lot of difficulties rendering the emojis in their full glory in MatPlotlib,
                    which led us to use d3 in our later visualizations.
                </p>

                <div class="pic-set--main">
                    <img src="../assets/code/happy_sad_sleepy_mad.png" />
                </div>

                <p class="whisper">
                    As seen from these visualizatons to the right, the BlobText API classified most tweets as neutral. We decided that the information that BlobText gave us was not particularly useful. As a result, we decided to pivot our focus to the specific context these emojis were used, rather than just sentiment.
                </p>

                <h3>Context Vectors</h3>
                <p>
                    We implemented an algorithm that mapped each word to its sparse word vector, then calculated the cosine distance from emojis to each word. We chose four fairly popular emojis (happy, sad, sleepy, mad) and the top used languages (English, Japanese, Spanish) in our database. We found some
                    interesting nuances, such as Japan's sad emoji had some positive words, such as beautiful, and their
                    tired emojis would relate to academia, which wasn't found in the other languages. We also explored
                    predicting the sentiment of a tweet given the emojis in the tweet, using SVMs and decision trees.

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                    To put all our work together, Minna and I created the poster for the project. This poster includes other fun visualizations that I didn't mention here. Developing these visualizations sparked a personal interest for me, which inspires to do more data visualization in the future. Additionally, our poster won best visualization in the class!
